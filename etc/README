Welcome to your backdoor. I hope you have a whaaaaaale of a time.
I won't kill you with a wall of text, so here's all the
important shizzle:
    
    - FILE/PROCESS HIDING is GID based ONLY.
      Extended attributes are great, but not ALL boxes
      have 'em. Plus they're a bit slower to use.
      This also means that ANY FILES you create are
      automatically hidden.
    - I assume you've connected to this BACKDOOR
      by utilising your HIDDEN PORT. If not, I suggest
      you do that now. You can use my ssh.sh to do that.
    - Your HOME DIRECTORY is VITAL. I've put SCRIPTS in
      your HOME DIR, which RESIDE IN 'etc/'. You can RUN
      THEM for more information.
