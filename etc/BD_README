             LD_PRELOAD Linux rootkit...
 
  Warning: I am not responsible whatsoever for your actions. Ever.

  General information:
    - File & process hiding is managed by a magic GID.
    - Bedevil will persistently try to maintain control.

  Presence hiding:
    - The presence of the rootkit library is hidden from the
      following:
      - /proc/*/maps
      - /proc/*/smaps
      - /proc/*/numa_maps
      - Processes (default): lsrootkit, ldd, unhide, rkhunter,
                             chkproc, chkdirs, ltrace, strace
      - Paths (default): */*ld-linux*.so.*, *ld-linux*.so.*,
                         */*ld-*.so, *ld-*.so, */utmp, utmp
      - Vars (default): LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS, LD_DEBUG, LD_AUDIT

  Port hiding:
    - Ports you want hidden should be written to '~/hide_ports'.
      You can write port ranges too by using a hyphen as the range
      delimiter.
        Example:
          103
          106-108
          200-205
          31
    - Ports/port ranges written to this file are redacted from
      '/proc/net/tcp*' output. Tools such as netstat will not show
      information about hidden network connections.

  Logs information:
    - If 'LOG_LOCAL_AUTH' is enabled, the logs are written to
      '~/auth_logs', with respective usernames and passwords.

    - If 'LOG_SSH' is enabled, the logs are written to '~/ssh_logs',
      with the host connected to, along with the username and
      password used.
